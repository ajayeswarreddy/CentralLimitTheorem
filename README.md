Communication for analytics - Central Limit Theorem

This project is about demonstrating CLT and how regardless of the underlying distribution, we get an approximately normal distribution for the sample means with big enough sample size. The project does this by generating random realizations from a distribution through inverse cdf method. The realizations thus obtained are plotted as a histogram. 

The project uses a fair die and unfair die as an example to showcase the above. It also shows how the mean of the resulting normal looking distribution is approximately equal to the underlying population's true mean and how variance decreases with increasing sample size. 

It also puts some of the limitations of CLT on display using the above example as sample means for a die are restricted between 1 and 6 which means the resulting distribution has only densities for values between 1 and 6 and not the entire spectrum of numbers like a normal distribution.
